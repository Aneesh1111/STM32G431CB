# STM32G431CB
Programming an ***STM32G431CB*** microcontroller (the ***B-G431B-ESC1 Discovery kit***) for motor controllers on a three wheeled robot with omnidirectional wheels.

The blinking of the LEDs (linker script, startup, and main) were all adopted/adjusted versions following the tutorial in: https://kleinembedded.com/stm32-without-cubeide-part-1-the-bare-necessities/

# Installation & Usage

[How to clone the repo]( https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?platform=mac#cloning-a-repository)

## Required Packages

* [openocd](https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd)
  > Note the following packages are required to use `openocd`: 
  - make
  - libtool
  - pkg-config >= 0.23 or pkgconf
  - autoconf >= 2.69
  - automake >= 1.14
  - texinfo >= 5.0
  - libusb-1.0.


---

First, run:
```
  $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
```

Then go inside the `openocd` directory. Run the following commands sequentially:
> Note for `macos` you need to run: `$ brew install automake` and `$ brew install libusb` for the following to work.
```
  $ ./bootstrap
```
```
  $ ./configure --enable-stlink
```
```
  $ make
```
```
  $ sudo make install
```

---

## Compiling & Executing

To build the executable in the ***STM32G431CB*** directory, invoke `arm-none-eabi_gcc`:
```
  $ arm-none-eabi-gcc src/main.c sec/startup.c -T linker_script.ld -o blink.elf -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -nostdlib
```

Then, to:
- Program the binary to the target
- Verify that it was programmed correctly
- Reset the target
- Exit OpenOCD
run:
```
  $ openocd -f ~/openocd/tcl/interface/stlink.cfg -f ~/openocd/tcl/target/stm32f4x.cfg -c "program blink.elf verify reset exit"
```
