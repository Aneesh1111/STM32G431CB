# STM32G431CB
Programming an STM32G431CB microcontroller (the B-G431B-ESC1 Discovery kit) for motor controllers on a three wheeled robot with omnidirectional wheels.

The blinking of the LEDs (linker script, startup, and main) were all adopted/adjusted versions following the tutorial in: https://kleinembedded.com/stm32-without-cubeide-part-1-the-bare-necessities/
